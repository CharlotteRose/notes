read me 

create a master module called _services_ that imports other class modules 
which will be a topic|command - the class sructure for the topic/service 
will allow each service/topic to have identifiable features 
- logs
- error codes
- common commands 
- command description 
- configuration files 
- selinux rules -> this is a maybe 

Topics: ownership, file permissions, 
Quiz methodology? 
? flash card style? 
? fill in the blank? 
? guess the command ? 
? recite description of command ?

REFINED PLAN | Node model for "commands" and descriptions" 
man -k lists man pages in format of:  man_page_name (n) 
- the convenience of the command and the output provided is that we are able to see the numeral value for the gz file that will contain
  the general information for the command 
- this list out put will be written to a file 
    man -k yum >> commands.txt
- the resultant file will be parsed to create a dictionary in format of {command_name: ["description","int"]}  where the key is a singular
  command and the values are a list of items, namely description and page
- this fabulous dictionary - will provide the information needed to ascertain the man page which can the be parsed into {"option": "string"}
- then this resultant dict will be randonly worked through for the learning quiz ^_^
